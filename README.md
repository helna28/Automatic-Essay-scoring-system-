Automated Essay Scoring (AES) using LSTM and GloVe Embeddings

The goal is to develop a system that:
Automatically evaluates an essay and predicts a score (0â€“6).
Provides personalized feedback about grammar, structure, clarity, and content.
Uses AI and NLP to mimic human essay grading

The model uses an essay dataset [(e.g., essay_llama3_8B_groq.csv)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=essay_llama3_8B_groq.csv) containing:
Essay ID
Full text of the essay
Human-assigned score (target variable)
